# Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
# A: http://www4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~jnweiger/screen-faq.html
# The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the alternate text
# buffer is selected. The standard definitions of the termcap initialize
# capabilities ti and te switch to and from the alternate text buffer. (The
# scrollbar also does not work when you start e.g. .vi.). You can tell
# screen not to use these initialisations by adding
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@
